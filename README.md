ABSTRACT
<p align="justify">
The main target of this project is to implement text detection with an audio output for individuals who are driving and walking with eye conditions. MATLAB will be integrated into the code to simulate and visualize the desired results of this endeavor. The main concepts highlighted concern optical character recognition (OCR) and detectTextCRAFT, which is a deep learning model for character region awareness for text detection (CRAFT).  Moreover, the speak operation will be assimilated to accumulate audio outputs that correspond to the detected texts using ocr and detectTextCRAFT. Several other syntaxes from MATLAB are utilized to enhance the efficiency and proficiency of the program. A selection of images is also encompassed to determine the success rate and errors present within the code. In the latter part of the paper, recommendations regarding the limitations of this project are stated to instill more knowledge for future researchers who desire to tackle an identical scope.
